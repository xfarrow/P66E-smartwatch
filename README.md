# P66E
Reverse engineering a P66E smartwatch. Using the [Gadgetbridge's guide](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/BT-Protocol-Reverse-Engineering).

### Other names
The P66E comes with different commercial names such as
- Ddidbi Smart Watch
- Sudugo P66E
- Poounur P66E

## What we know so far
Unfortunately this device does not respect the Bluetooth GATT specifications. This will make the process of reverse engineering harder, as we need to sniff the traffic between the P66E and the companion app (Gloryfit).
